Experimental MaMa interpreter

building
========

./make.sh

Requires a compiler for D version 1 
See: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/

Tested on gdc (mac), but probably works with dmd v1 if you change 'make.sh'.

usage
=====

mama [options] <file.cbn> 
Options: 
-v       	 print state and instruction on every step       
-i       	 print instruction for every step
-s       	 after execution, print statistics 
-r       	 only print result (overrides all previous) 
-?       	 usage info 
-steps n 	 execute at most n steps



deviations from spec
====================

* invalid pointer is 'null' not -1

todo
====

* add test codes
* write down useful compiling flags
* test on windows
* get jaak to add '#!env mama' to compiler
* figure out testing framework for the compiler
